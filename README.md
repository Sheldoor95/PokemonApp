# PokemonApp
This is a training exercise only

## Explanations
The project loads the first 151 pokemon (the first generation of the Kanto region) from the PokeApi API. 
The URl request is made through an async function containing the try await of the Url session. 
The data populates a view with a list of Pokemon made up of names and images searchable by the search bar. 
Clicking on each pokemon will open a detailed view containing id, weight and height.
